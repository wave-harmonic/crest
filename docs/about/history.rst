|version|
---------

Changed
^^^^^^^
.. bullet_list::

   -  Add support for multiple cameras to the *Underwater Renderer*.
      One limitation is that underwater culling will be disabled when using multiple *Underwater Renderer*s.
   -  ShapeFFT/Gerstner can now take a mesh renderer as an input.
   -  Add *Crest/Inputs/Shape Waves/Sample Spectrum* shader which samples the spectrum using a texture.
   -  Ocean inputs provided via the *Register* components now sort on sibling index in addition to queue, so multiple inputs with the same queue can be organised in the hierarchy to control sort order.
   -  Add ability to alpha blend waves (effectively an override) instead of only having additive blend waves.
      Set *Blend Mode* to *Alpha Blend* on the *ShapeFFT* or *ShapeGerstner* to use.
      It's useful for preventing rivers and lakes from receiving ocean waves.
   -  Add *Water Tile Prefab* field to *Ocean Renderer* to provide more control over water tile mesh renderers like reflection probes settings.
   -  Warn users that edits in prefab mode will not be reflected in scene view until prefab is saved.
   -  Validate that no scale can be applied to the *OceanRenderer*.
   -  Viewpoint validation has been removed as it was unnecessary and spammed the logs.
   -  Whirlpool now executes in edit mode.
   -  *Visualise Ray Trace* now executes in edit mode.
   -  *Render Alpha On Surface* now executes in edit mode.
   -  Only report no Shape component validation as help boxes (ie no more console logs).
   -  Remove outdated lighting validation.
   -  Validate layers to warn users of potential build failures if *Crest* related renderers are not on the same layer as the *OceanRenderer.Layer*.
   -  No longer log info level validation to the console.
   -  Add info validation for tips on using reflection probes when found in a scene.
   -  Set *Ocean Renderer* *Wind Speed* default value to the maxmimum to reduce UX friction for new users.
   -  Also search *Addressables* and *Resources* for ocean materials when stripping keywords from underwater shader.
   -  Add *Ocean Renderer > Extents Size Multiplier* to adjust the extents so they can be increased in size to meet the horizon in cases where they do not.


Fixed
^^^^^
.. bullet_list::

   -  Fix FFTs incorrectly adding extra foam.
   -  Limit minimum phase period of flow technique applied to waves to fix objectionable phasing issues in flowing water like rivers.
   -  Fix some components breaking in edit mode after entering/exiting prefab mode.
   -  Fix *Build Processor* deprecated/obsolete warnings.
   -  Fix spurious "headless/batch mode" error during builds.

   -  No longer execute when building which caused several issues.
   -  Fix self-intersecting polygon (and warning) on Ferry model.
   -  Fix *Examples* scene UI not scaling and thus looking incorrect for non 4K resolution.
   -  Fix build failure for *main* scene if reflection probe is added that excluded the *Water* layer.
   -  Prevent bad values (NaN etc) from propagating in the *Dynamic Waves* simulation.
      This manifested as the water surface disappearing from a singlar point.
   -  Fix shader include path error when moving `Crest` folder from the standard location.
   -  No longer disable the *Underwater Renderer* if it fails validation.

   .. only:: birp or urp

4.15.2
------

Changed

4.15.1
------

Fixed
^^^^^
.. bullet_list::

4.15
----

Breaking
^^^^^^^^
.. bullet_list::

   -  Ocean inputs will now only execute the first shader pass (pass zero).
      Before all passes were executed in sequence which caused incompatibilities with `URP` unlit *Shader Graph*.
      This is only a concern to those who are using custom shaders with multiple passes which we believe is very few.

Preview
^^^^^^^
.. bullet_list::

   -  Add new CPU-based collision provider - *Baked FFT Data*.
   -  Add portals and volumes to *Underwater Renderer* (affects both underwater and ocean surface).

   -  Add *Shader API* to *Underwater Renderer* to facilate adding underwater fog to transparent objects.
      See :ref:`underwater-shader-api` for more information.
   -  Add *Albedo Data* feature which allows layering colour onto the water surface similar to decals.

Changed

   -  Add *Allow No Shadows* to *Sim Settings Shadows* to allow shadows to be enabled/disabled dynamically.
   -  Add *Ocean Renderer >  Water Body Culling* option so the ocean can ignore culling.
      Useful if using *Water Body > Override Material* and still want an ocean.
   -  Improve multiple *Water Body* overlapping case when *Water Body > Override Material* option is used.
   -  Water Body adds an inclusion to clipping (ie unclips) if *Default Clipping State* is *Everything Clipped*.

   -  Add new example scene *BoatWakes* to showcase improvements to *SphereWaterInteraction* component.
   -  Allow scaling FFT waves on spline (not supported previously). *SplinePointDataGerstner* has been renamed to *SplinePointDataWaves* which works for both *ShapeFFT* and *ShapeGerstner*.
   -  Add *Surface Self-Intersection Fix Mode* (advanced option) to control how self-intersections of the ocean surface caused by intense/choppy waves are handled.
   -  Add *Maximum Buoyancy Force* for preventing objects from having too much force being applied when fully submerged.
   -  Updated all example scenes.

   .. only:: hdrp
