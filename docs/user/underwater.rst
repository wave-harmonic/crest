Underwater
==========

.. image:: /_media/UnderwaterPostProcess.png

*Crest* supports seamless transitions above/below water.
It can also have a meniscus which renders a subtle line at the intersection between the camera lens and the water to visually help the transition.
This is demonstrated in the *main.unity* scene in the example content.
The ocean in this scene uses the material *Ocean-Underwater.mat* which enables rendering the underside of the surface.

Out-scattering is provided as an example script which reduces environmental lighting with depth underwater.
See the *UnderwaterEnvironmentalLighting* component.

For performance reasons, the underwater effect is disabled if the viewpoint is not underwater.
Only the camera rendering the ocean surface will be used.

.. tip::

   Use opaque or alpha test materials for underwater surfaces.
   Transparent materials may not render correctly underwater.
   See :ref:`transparent-object-underwater` for possible workarounds.


Underwater Renderer
-------------------

.. note::

   You can enable/disable rendering in the scene view by toggling fog in the :link:`scene view control bar <{UnityDocLink}/ViewModes.html>`.

The *Underwater Renderer* component executes a fullscreen underwater effect between the transparent pass and post-processing pass.

It is similar to a post-processing effect, but has the benefit of allowing other renderers to execute after it and still receive post-processing.
An example is to add underwater fog correctly to semi-transparent objects.

Setup
^^^^^

.. only:: birp

   .. tab:: `BIRP`

      -  Configure the ocean material for underwater rendering.
         In the *Underwater* section of the material params, ensure *Enabled* is turned on and *Cull Mode* is set to *Off* so that the underside of the ocean surface renders.
         See *Ocean-Underwater.mat* for an example.

.. only:: hdrp

   .. tab:: `HDRP`

      -  Configure the ocean material for underwater rendering.
         Ensure that *Double-Sided* is enabled under *Surface Options* on the ocean material so that the underside of the ocean surface renders.
         See *Ocean-Underwater.mat* for an example.

.. only:: urp

   .. tab:: `URP`

      -  Configure the ocean material for underwater rendering.
         In the *Underwater* section of the material params, ensure *Enabled* is turned on and *Cull Mode* is set to *Off* so that the underside of the ocean surface renders.
         See *Ocean-Underwater.mat* for an example.

-  Add the *Underwater Renderer* component to your camera game object.


Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^

-  **Mode:** How the underwater effect (and ocean surface) is rendered:

   -  **Full-Screen:** Full screen effect.
   -  **Portal:** Renders the underwater effect and ocean surface from the geometry's front-face and behind it.
   -  **Volume:** Renders the underwater effect and ocean surface from the geometry's front-face to its back-face.
   -  **Volume (Fly-Through):** Renders the underwater effect and ocean surface from the geometry's front-face to its back-face - even from within the volume.

-  **Depth Fog Density Factor:** Reduces the underwater depth fog density by a factor.
   Useful to reduce the intensity of the fog independently from the ocean surface.


.. _detecting_above_or_below_water:

Detecting Above or Below Water
------------------------------

The *OceanRenderer* component has the *ViewerHeightAboveWater* property which can be accessed with ``OceanRenderer.Instance.ViewerHeightAboveWater``.
It will return the signed height from the ocean surface of the camera rendering the ocean.
Internally this uses the *SampleHeightHelper* class which can be found in *SamplingHelpers.cs*.

There is also the *OceanSampleHeightEvents* example component (requires example content to be imported) which uses :link:`UnityEvents <{UnityDocLink}/UnityEvents.html>` to provide a scriptless approach to triggering changes.
Simply attach it to a game object, and it will invoke a UnityEvent when the attached game object is above or below the ocean surface once per state change. A common use case is to use it to trigger different audio when above or below the surface.


.. _portals-volumes:

Portals & Volumes
-----------------

.. admonition:: Preview

   This feature is in preview and may change in the future.

The underwater effect can be rendered from a provided mesh which will effectively become a portal (2D) or volume (3D).
Change the *Mode* property to one of your choosing and set the *Volume Geometry* to a *Mesh Filter* (it will use its transform).
This feature also clips the ocean surface to match.
A common use case would be a window on a boat.


.. _underwater-shader-api:

Underwater Shader API
---------------------

.. admonition:: Preview

   This feature is in preview and may change in the future.

The underwater effect uses opaque depth and thus will not render correctly for transparent objects.
Too much fog will be applied as it is as if the transparent object does not exist.

The most effective approach is to render the transparent objects after the underwater effect and apply the underwater effect as part of the shader for the transparent object (basically the same way Unity fog is applied).

The *Shader API* needs to be enabled on the *Underwater Renderer* (located under the *Shader API* heading).


.. only:: birp

   .. tab:: `BIRP`

      Once the *Shader API* is enabled, the underwater effect will be rendered before the transparent pass instead of after it, and the global shader properties will be populated.
      This means that when a transparent object is rendered, it will already have underwater fog behind it.
      It is then just a matter of applying the underwater fog to the transparent object.

      .. admonition:: Example

         |  We have an example *Surface Shader* which you can use as a reference:
         |  *Crest/Crest-Examples/Shared/Shaders/ExampleUnderwaterTransparentSurfaceShader.shader*

         Furthermore, you can view the shader in action in the *Transparent Object Underwater* example in the *Examples* scene.

      Setting up a shader can be broken down to the following:

      1. |  Including our includes file:
         |  *Crest/Crest/Shaders/Underwater/UnderwaterEffectIncludes.hlsl*
      2. Adding optional keywords (see example shader)
      3. Use the *CrestApplyUnderwaterFog* function to apply the fog to the final color

      Here is the important part from *ExampleUnderwaterTransparentSurfaceShader.shader*:

      .. code-block:: hlsl

         float2 positionNDC = IN.screenPos.xy / IN.screenPos.w;
         float deviceDepth = IN.screenPos.z / IN.screenPos.w;

         if (!CrestApplyUnderwaterFog(positionNDC, IN.worldPos, deviceDepth, _FogMultiplier, color.rgb))
         {
            UNITY_APPLY_FOG(IN.fogCoord, color);
         }

.. only:: hdrp

   .. tab:: `HDRP`

      .. include:: includes/_underwater-shader-graph.rst

      For best results using the `HDRP_Lit_Shader` graph:

      -  Keep *Preserve Specular Lighting* disabled as this will cause the object to be visible from any distance
      -  Do not enable *Receive Fog* as this will write over the emission and thus underwater fog
      -  Be mindful of what features on the *Shader Graph* you enable as it might affect the underwater fog
